## Lighthouse
 - Lighthouse testing was carried out in Developer Tools in Chrome. Initially it gave a number of improvements and flagged up a number of images that needed to be reduced in size. Which was done.

 - The results were also skewed as the chrome extensions on my testing device was affecting the lighthouse results. The tests of all pages were redone in a incognito window and performance score increased.

## Manual Testing
  - All the site links were manually tested to see if they all worked ok and linked to the correct locations.
  - The form was checked that name and email were required, that the radio buttons functioned and that the submit button worked.
  - The site was further tested using feedback from mentor,family and friends who checked it on diffrent devices they had.
  - The site was carefully tested across a variety of devices to ensure that all links and styling function properly, as well as responsiveness. All of the page's features were tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Opera .
  - Google Chrome's Developer Tool was used to inspect page elements during the build and helped indentify and debug issues within the HTML and CSS.
  - The README.md was checked before final submission and links verfied.



# Bugs

  - After running the site through HTML checker, a number of small bugs were identified. Each error was identified and an appropriate solution applied, i went through all pages and fixed any errors. It was good lesson and practice in finding problems with code and fixing them.
  - After Running the all pages through lighthouse, it identified issues with a number of images due to size. Lighthouse suggested to change some larger images from jpg to avif which was done
  - The what we do section on the home page i was having trouble in getting it to be responsvie, i decieded to implement css grid which worked out well and fixed the problem
  - On low quailty smart phones with with pixle width less than 300px the hompe page hero text banner did not work properly, so i decided to add a media query and remove it  as i felt it was affecting user experience.

  # Unfixed Bugs
  - Aparting from removeing the hero banner text from the hompage for smart phones with screen sizes below 300px i am unaware of any other bugs at this time.

   # Conclusion
    - I would put more emphasis on a mobile first design when it came to building out the site.
    - If I was to build this site again, I would spend more time on the wireframes and know exactly how to structure each section and element before i start.
    - Due to time constraints, I did not have time to experiment a lot with flex or CSS grid, I think I could have got a better services page layout with CSS grid.
    - I would also learn to make more commits during the project built.
