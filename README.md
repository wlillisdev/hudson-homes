# Testing

### Validator Testing 

 - HTML Validator
   - [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) site was used to validate the **HTML** code.
   - A number of small errors were initially flagged up. Some duplicate tags were removed and I also had to rename a number of images. I also misplaced a link tag in the homepage, as I copied this page structure for the rest of the site i had to fix it on all of these pages also

  ![CSS Pass](assets/images/readme-images/css-pass.png)

  ### See links below for Results:

## Lighthouse
 - Lighthouse testing was carried out in Developer Tools in Chrome. Initially it gave a number of improvements and flagged up a number of images that needed to be reduced in size. Which was done.

 - The results were also skewed as the chrome extensions on my testing device was affecting the lighthouse results. The tests of all pages were redone in a incognito window and performance score increased.

 - [Service Page lighthouse results](assets/images/readme-images/light-house-service.png)
 - [Contact Us lighthoust results](assets/images/readme-images/light-house-contact.png)

## Manual Testing
  - All the site links were manually tested to see if they all worked ok and linked to the correct locations.
  - The form was checked that name and email were required, that the radio buttons functioned and that the submit button worked.
  - The site was further tested using feedback from mentor,family and friends who checked it on diffrent devices they had.
  - All of the page's features were tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, and Opera .
  - Google Chrome's Developer Tool was used to inspect page elements during the build and helped indentify and debug issues within the HTML and CSS.
  - The README.md was checked before final submission and links verfied.



# Bugs

  - After running the site through HTML checker, a number of small bugs were identified. Each error was identified and an appropriate solution applied, i went through all pages and fixed any errors. It was good lesson and practice in finding problems with code and fixing them.
  - After Running all the pages through lighthouse, it identified issues with a number of images due to size. Lighthouse suggested to change some larger images which was done.
  - The what we do section on the home page i was having trouble in getting it to be responsvie, i decieded to implement css grid which worked out well and fixed the problem
  - On low quailty smart phones with with pixle width less than 300px the hompe page hero text banner did not look great, so i decided to add a media query and remove it  as i felt it was affecting user experience.

  # Unfixed Bugs
  - Apart from removeing the hero banner text from the hompage for smart phones with screen sizes below 300px i am unaware of any other bugs at this time.

   # Conclusion
    - I would put more emphasis on a mobile first design when it came to building out the site.
    - If I was to build this site again, I would spend more time on the wireframes and know exactly how to structure each section and element before i start.
    - Due to time constraints, I did not have time to experiment a lot with flex or CSS grid, I think I could have got a better services page layout with CSS grid.
    - I would also learn to make more commits during the project built.
